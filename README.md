# **A-Maze-ing**

## **Description**

**A-Maze-ing** is a Python-based maze generation and solution visualizer. The goal of this project is to algorithmically generate mazes, visualize their creation process in real-time within the terminal, and solve them using pathfinding algorithms.

The project features a modular design allowing for different generation algorithms, customizable colors, and a specific "42" pattern embedded within the maze walls. It uses ANSI escape codes to render animations directly in the console.

## **Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**

* Python 3.10 or higher.  
* pip package manager.

### **Installation**

To install the necessary dependencies (flake8, mypy for linting), run:

make install

### **Execution**

To generate and solve a maze using the default configuration:

make run

Or manually:

python3 a\_maze\_ing.py config.txt

### **Interactive Controls**

Once the maze is generated and solved, an interactive menu allows you to:

1. **Re-generate maze:** Create a new maze with the current settings (or new seed).  
2. **Show/Hide solution:** Toggle the visibility of the pathfinding solution.  
3. **Change colors:** Customize wall and pattern colors.  
4. **Change Algorithm:** Switch between Backtracking and Prim's algorithm on the fly.

### **Other Commands**

* make lint: Run code quality checks (flake8 and mypy).  
* make clean: Remove cache files and temporary artifacts.

## **Configuration File Structure**

The behavior of the generator is controlled by a config.txt file. The format is KEY=VALUE (no spaces around the equals sign).

**Example config.txt:**

\# Maze config  
WIDTH=15  
HEIGHT=13  
ENTRY=0,0  
EXIT=14,12  
OUTPUT\_FILE=maze.txt  
PERFECT=false  
SEED=42

| Key | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| WIDTH | Integer. The width of the maze grid. |
| HEIGHT | Integer. The height of the maze grid. |
| ENTRY | Tuple x,y. Coordinates for the starting point. |
| EXIT | Tuple x,y. Coordinates for the ending point. |
| OUTPUT\_FILE | String. Filename to save the hexagonal representation of the maze. |
| PERFECT | Boolean (true/false). If true, the maze has no loops. If false, walls are removed to create loops. |
| SEED | Integer (Optional). Seed for random generation to reproduce specific mazes. |

## **Maze Generation Algorithms**

We selected two distinct algorithms to provide variety in the visual generation process and the resulting maze structure:

1. **Recursive Backtracking (DFS):**  
   * **Description:** A "drunken walk" approach that carves passages until it hits a dead end, then backtracks to the last valid cell.  
   * **Why we chose it:** It produces long, winding corridors with fewer dead ends, making the maze look like a river or a snake. It is visually satisfying to watch the "stack" operation in the animation.  
2. **Prim's Algorithm:**  
   * **Description:** Starts from a grid full of walls and grows the maze from a starting cell by adding random frontier neighbors.  
   * **Why we chose it:** In contrast to DFS, Prim's generates a branching structure with many short dead ends. It creates a more "organic" spread during the visualization, offering a different challenge to the solver.

**Solving Algorithm:**

* **BFS (Breadth-First Search):** Used to find the shortest path from Entry to Exit. It guarantees the optimal solution in an unweighted grid.

## **Reusable Code**

The project is structured as a package (mazegen), separating logic from the execution script.

* **mazegen/maze\_generator.py**: The MazeGenerator class is entirely reusable. It can be imported into other projects (e.g., a GUI-based maze game or a web backend) to generate grid data structures without relying on the terminal display.  
* **mazegen/maze\_display.py**: The ANSI color logic is encapsulated here. While specific to terminal output, the class structure allows it to be swapped for a GUI-based display class (like PyGame) while keeping the Generator logic used in a\_maze\_ing.py intact.

## **Team and Project Management**

### **Roles**

* **mlakhlil:** Focused heavily on the core algorithmic logic. Implemented the **Backtracking** and **Prim's** generation algorithms and handled the primary visualization logic for the grid.  
* **rhssayn:** Focused on the **User Experience** and specific constraints. Implemented the hardcoded **"42" pattern**, the **BFS Pathfinding** algorithm, the animation delays, and the interactive menu system (changing colors, toggling paths).

### **Planning & Evolution**

We initially planned to work on the entire project simultaneously. However, as we progressed, we naturally discovered different approaches to managing the maze data and visualization.

* **Evolution:** Instead of forcing a single workflow, we pivoted to leverage our individual strengths. We split the workload: one focused on the "math/logic" (algorithms) and the other on the "features/polish" (patterns, solving, UX).  
* **Convergence:** In the final phase, we sat down together to integrate the features and ensure the code adhered to the requirements. This pair-programming session helped us understand each other's perspectives and debug edge cases.

### **Retrospective**

* **What worked well:** Dividing tasks based on interest (Algorithms vs. UX) resulted in a polished product with robust logic. The final integration phase was crucial for knowledge transfer.  
* **Improvements:** Initial synchronization could have been better to avoid minor merge conflicts in the core Cell structure early on.

### **Tools Used**

* **Custom Simulator:** We built a simple web-based simulation tool to visualize how the algorithms propagate. This saved significant time compared to debugging purely through terminal text output.  
* **Git:** For version control.

## **Resources**

* **Algorithms:** [Wikipedia \- Maze generation algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm)  
* **Python Typing:** [Python Docs \- typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)

### **AI Usage**

AI was utilized as a supportive tool throughout the development process:

1. **Algorithm Understanding:** Used to break down the steps of Prim's algorithm to ensure correct implementation of the "frontier" logic.  
2. **Code Organization:** Assisted in structuring the project into a proper Python package (handling \_\_init\_\_.py and imports).  
3. **Optimization & Verification:** Used to check for potential infinite loops in the while structures and to verify that no requirements from the subject were missed during the final review.
